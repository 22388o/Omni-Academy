Total score of this examination is 600 points, with each of the following sections 100 scores.  

Section 1. Knowledge base of Blockchain        
Section 2. Bitcoin network and Omnilayer specification  
Section 3. Smart contract, Ethereum and HyperLedger  
Section 4. Lightning network, LND and OmniBOLT specification  
Section 5. Security    
Section 6. System Maintenance
